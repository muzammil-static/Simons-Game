# Simons-Game
Simon is a classic memory-based game that tests how well you can remember and repeat a growing sequence of colors and sounds. The game features four colored buttons—red, blue, green, and yellow—each associated with a unique tone.
The game starts by lighting up one button. Your task is to repeat the exact sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order. Each time you succeed, the game adds another color to the sequence, making it more challenging.

The goal is to see how long you can keep up without making a mistake. It's a fun and addictive way to sharpen your memory and concentration skills!
